Usage:
    
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    sh quanTIseq_pipeline.sh --inputfile="path/to/input_file.txt" [options]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	--inputfile: 	path to the input file (mandatory). The input file is a tab-delimited 
					text file, with no header, reporting the information about the RNA-seq 
					data to be analyzed, one sample per row. For each sample, it must 
					contain three columns specifying: the ID of the sample, the path to the
					first FASTQ file, and the path to the second FASTQ file for paired-end 
					data. For single-end data, the third column must report the string "None". 
					FASTQ files can be gzipped (".gz" extension). 
	
					To run quanTIseq with the pipelinestart="decon" option, the input file 
					must be a tab-delimited text file with the gene TPM (or microarray 
					expression values) for all samples to be deconvoluted (gene symbols 
					on the first column and sample IDs on the first row). 
					Expression data must be on non-log scale.

	OPTIONS
	
	--help: 		prints these instructions.

	--outputdir: 	path to the output directory. 
					Default:  current directory.

	--prefix: 		prefix of the output files. 
					Default: "quanTIseq".

	--threads: 		number of threads to be used. 
					Default: 1.

	--pipelinestart: step from which the pipeline must be started as illustrated in Figure 1: 
					(1) "preproc", (2) "expr", or (3) "decon". Note: if "decon", the input file 
					must be a tab-delimited text file with the gene TPM (or microarray expression 
					values) for all samples to be deconvoluted (gene symbols on the first column 
					and sample IDs on the first row). Expression data must be on non-log scale. 
					Default: "preproc".

	--phred: 		encoding of the RNA-seq quality scores for read preprocessing with Trimmomatic: 
					"33" for Phred-33 or "64" for Phred-64. 
					Default: 33.

	--adapterSeed: 	maximum number of seed mismatches for the identification of adapter sequences 
					by Trimmomatic. 
					Default: 2.

	--palindromeClip: threshold for palindrome clipping of adapter sequences by Trimmomatic. 
					Default: 30.

	--simpleClip: 	threshold for simple clipping of adapter sequences by Trimmomatic. 
					Default: 10.

	--trimLead: 	minimum Phred quality required by Trimmomatic to keep a base at the start of a 
					read. Bases with lower quality are trimmed. 
					Default: 20.

	--trimTrail: 	minimum Phred quality required by Trimmomatic to keep a base at the end of a 
					read. Bases with lower quality are trimmed. 
					Default: 20.

	--minLen: 		minimum read length required by Trimmomatic to keep a read. Reads shorter than 
					this threshold are discared. 
					Default: 36.

	--crop: 		maximum read length required by Trimmomatic. Longer reads are trimmed to this 
					maximum length by removing bases at the end of the read. 
					Default: 10000.

	--rawcounts: 	specifies whether a file of gene raw counts must be generated in addition to TPM. 
					Default: FALSE.

	--arrays: 		specifies whether expression data are from microarrays (instead of RNA-seq). 
					If TRUE, the "--rmgenes" parameter is set to "none". 
					Default: FALSE.

	--tumor: 		specifies whether expression data are from tumor samples. If TRUE, signature genes 
					with high expression in tumor samples are removed (see [1]). 
					Default: FALSE.

	--mRNAscale: 	specifies whether cell fractions must be scaled to account for cell-type-specific 
					mRNA content. 
					Default: TRUE.

	--totalcells: 	path to a tab-separated text file containing the total cell densities estimated 
					from images of tumor tissue-slides. The file must have no header and contain, on 
					the first column, the sample IDs, and on the second column, and the number of total 
					cells per mm2 estimated from tumor images, e.g. from images of haematoxylin and eosin 
					(H&E)-stained tissue slides. quanTIseq computes cell densities for all the cell types 
					of the signature matrix and all the samples present in both the "inputfile" and 
					"totalcell" files.

	--rmgenes: 		specifies which genes must be removed from the signature matrix before running 
					deconvolution. This parameter can be equal to:

					- "none": no genes are removed;
					- "default": the list of genes reported in this file are removed;
					- A path to a text file containing a list of genes to be removed can be specified. 
						The text file must report one gene symbol per line.
	
					We advise using "default" and "none" for the deconvolution of RNA-seq and microarray data, 
					respectively. 
					Default: "default".
					
	--method: 		deconvolution method to be used: "hampel", "huber", or "bisquare" for robust regression 
					with Huber, Hampel, or Tukey bisquare estimators, respectively, or "lsei" for constrained 
					least squares regression. The fraction of uncharacterized cells ("other") is computed only 
					by the "lsei" method. 
					Default: "lsei".
